## Week-5- Challenge

# Overview of Analysis

I was teamed up with Omar to compile data for PyBer. Our goal was to show the differences of weekly fares for city types from there ride data. This will help the decision makers of Pyber make important decisions in regards to coverage and pricing for their services in different areas.

# Results
PyBer groups their cities into three categories (rual, suburban, and urban). The city group "Urban" has the most rides and the most drivers. The cities that fell under the urban grouping generated the highest amount of fares ($39,854). Even though the urban cities generated the most rides and the highest amount of fares, the drivers within the urban grouping did not generate the highester fare per driver. The drivers that cover the Rural cities earned the highest fare per ride and driver. The suburban community fell right between rural and urban in generating rides and fares. This makes sense for rural rides to cost the most as they need to drive the furthest out of the city. They have less drivers within the rural community so there is less oppurunities for the riders. The may last longer as there is a greater distance between stops.
