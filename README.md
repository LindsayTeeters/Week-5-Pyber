# Week-5- Challenge

## Overview of Analysis

I was teamed up with Omar to compile data for PyBer. Our goal was to show the differences of weekly fares for city types from there ride data. This will help the decision makers of Pyber make important decisions in regards to coverage and pricing for their services in different areas.

## Results
PyBer groups their cities into three categories (rual, suburban, and urban). The city group "Urban" has the most rides and the most drivers. The cities that fell under the urban grouping generated the highest amount of fares ($39,854). Even though the urban cities generated the most rides and the highest amount of fares, the drivers within the urban grouping did not generate the highester fare per driver. The drivers that cover the Rural cities earned the highest fare per ride and driver. The suburban community fell right between rural and urban in generating rides and fares. This makes sense for rural rides to cost the most as they need to drive the furthest out of the city. They have less drivers within the rural community so there is less oppurunities for the riders. The may last longer as there is a greater distance between stops.

## Summary
The data we generated for Pyber can help the decision makers by knowing the differences within the city groupings. The Urban rides make up 68% of the total rides and 81% of the drivers while their fare averages to be the lowest. It is okay to keep this rate lower as this is the bread and butter type of rides. The urban rides may be shorter and less expense but they are more frequent and can add up. If an increase is added to rides within the Urban grouping, I would suggest to keep the increase low. A 4.8% increase would increase the average fare up $1.00. Rural rides could incur a slightly higher increase as less options are available for this region. Howeever, competition could rise up so I would suggest to gradually increase fares over time. Suburban could be an area to look into to hiring drivers. They have 20% of the drivers that the Urban area has but they also have 49% of what the Uban area makes in fares.
